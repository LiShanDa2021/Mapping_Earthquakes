# Mapping Earthquakes

The challenge folder contains the final project in which I have. . .

1. Created a map with three data sets. . .
  + all earthquakes from the past 7 days
  + major (magnitude 4.5 or greater) earthquakes from the past 7 days
  + tectonic plate boundaries
2. Created three different map settings that provide different colors and contrasts to the data.

Thank you!
